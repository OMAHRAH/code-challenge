            Madrid are set to pay Dortmund in excess of €100million (£86m; $107m) in what will be one of the highest-value transfers 
            in the history of both clubs. The deal is not yet signed but that is among the formalities that will follow. Bellingham,
            19, is expected to undergo a medical in the coming days.
